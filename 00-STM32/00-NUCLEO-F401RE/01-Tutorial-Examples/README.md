# Electronics and Microcontroller Learning Samples

This repository contains sample code written by **DIBYENDU BARMAN**. The projects are designed to help amateur users integrate their knowledge of electronics with the basics of microcontroller connections. They focus on using digital pins, power supply considerations, and basic use cases through various scenarios, building experience on how to physically connect and control components.
The idea is to break down the learning process into hardware-specific tasks, such as interfacing components and using tools like the Keil Studio Cloud compiler and the ST Link Utility. This approach allows you to break down the learning process, leaving the coding part for future steps. The applications include:

- **LED Control:** Using onboard and external LEDs
- **Buzzer Interactions:** Driving buzzers for sound output
- **Button Handling:** Managing user inputs

## Project Details

- **Target OS:** Mbed OS 2
- **Development Environment:** Keil Studio Cloud
- **Usage:** Replace the default `.cpp` file in the Keil Studio Cloud project with the one provided in this repository to run the examples.

## Getting Started

1. **Open the online compiler:** Open Keil Studio Cloud and start a new Mbed project.
2. **Example project:** Choose the blinky example project for Mbed 2 OS. This allows you to build the right OS environment and files, necessary to run the project.
3. **Replace the Default Code:** Replace the default .cpp file in the project with the sample code provided here.
4. **Build and Run:** Follow the instructions in the youtube channel to set up your LEDs and other components. Compile, and open the .bin file using ST-Link Utility (this step requires your board to have an integrated ST Link debugger, or rather have an external ST Link peripheral, which is already part of the NUCLEO-F401RE).
